## PureSDN

PureSDN is a SDN-based traffic schduling application. Except the routing paths for hosts under the same switch, routing paths are calculated and installed completely by the Ryu controller.
It includes a set of Ryu applications collecting basic network information, such as topology and free bandwidth of links. PureSDN can achieve shortest path forwarding based on HOP or BANDWIDTH.
You can specify the mode of computing shortest paths when starting Ryu by adding "weight" argument. Moreover, you can set "k_paths" argument to support K-Shortest paths computing.
Fortunately, our application supports load balancing based on dynamic traffic information.

The detailed information of the modules is shown below:

* Fattree4 and Fattree8 are topology modules;

* Network Awareness is the module for collecting network information;

* Network Monitor is the module for collecting traffic information;

* PureSDN is the main module of the application;

* Setting is the module including common setting.

We make use of networkx's data structure to store topology. Meanwhile, we also utilize networkx's built-in algorithm to calculate shortest paths.


### Prerequisites

The following softwares should have been installed in your machine.
* Mininet: git clone git://github.com/mininet/mininet; mininet/util/install.sh -a
* Ryu: git clone git://github.com/osrg/ryu.git; cd ryu; pip install .
* Networkx: pip install networkx


### Download

Download files into Ryu directory, for instance, 'ryu/ryu/app/PureSDN' is OK.


### Make some change

To register parsing parameters, you NEED to add the following code into the end of ryu/ryu/flags.py.

    CONF.register_cli_opts([
        # k_shortest_forwarding
        cfg.IntOpt('k_paths', default=4, help='number of candidate paths of KSP.'),
        cfg.StrOpt('weight', default='bw', help='weight type of computing shortest path.'),
        cfg.IntOpt('fanout', default=4, help='switch fanout number.')])


### Reinstall Ryu

You must reinstall Ryu, so that you can run the new code. In the top directory of Ryu project:

    sudo python setup.py install


### Start

Note: Before doing the experiment, you should change the controller's IP address from '192.168.56.101' to your own machine's eth0 IP address in the fattree.py module in each application, because '192.168.56.101' is my computer's eth0 IP address (Try 'ifconfig' in your Ubuntu to find out the eth0's IP address). Otherwise, the switches can't connect to the controller.

Firstly, start up the network. An example is shown below:

    $ sudo python ryu/ryu/app/PureSDN/fattree4.py

And then, go into the top directory of Ryu, and run the application. You are suggested to add arguments when starting Ryu. An example is shown below:

    $ cd ryu
    $ ryu-manager --observe-links ryu/app/PureSDN/PureSDN.py --k_paths=4 --weight=bw --fanout=4

NOTE: After these, we should wait for the network to complete the initiation for several seconds, because LLDP needs some time to discovery the network topology. We can't operate the network until "[GET NETWORK TOPOLOGY]" is printed in the terminal of the Ryu controller, otherwise, some error will occur. It may be about 10 seconds for fattree4, and a little longer for fattree8.

After that, test the correctness of PureSDN:

    mininet> pingall
    mininet> iperf

If you want to show the collected information, you can set the parameters in setting.py. Also, you can change the setting as you like, such as the discovery period and monitor period. After that, you can see the information shown in the terminal.
